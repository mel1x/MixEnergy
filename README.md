## Key Features

- **Energy Consumption**: Players will now spend energy on the following actions:
  - **Running**: Energy is drained while sprinting.
  - **Breaking Blocks**: Mining and harvesting require energy.
  - **Building Blocks**: Placing blocks consumes energy.
  - **Attacking**: Performing attacks depletes energy.

  If the player runs out of energy, these actions will be temporarily **disabled** until energy is restored.

- **Energy Commands**:
  - `/setEnergy <value> <player:optional>`: Set a specific player's energy level. If no player is specified, it defaults to the executing player.
  - `/setMaxEnergy <value> <player:optional>`: Adjust the maximum energy limit for a player. Similar to `/setEnergy`, the command defaults to the executing player if no target is provided.

- **Energy HUD**
